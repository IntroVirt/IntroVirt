## Description

IntroVirt, short for introspective virtualization, is a customized Hypervisor and library that provides a robust virtual machine introspection (VMI) application programming interface (API). VMI is the process of looking at the memory contents of a virtual machine during runtime. By applying knowledge of the guest operating system, introspection can be used for a variety of applications, including reverse engineering, debugging software, and securing guest VMs by limiting access to files or limiting an executing application’s functionality.

IntroVirt consists of three components: a patched version of the [KVM Hypervisor](https://github.com/IntroVirt/kvm-introvirt), the [IntroVirt userland library](https://github.com/IntroVirt/IntroVirt), and a Microsoft Program Database (MS PDB) parsing library [libmspdb](https://github.com/IntroVirt/libmspdb/tree/main).

## Quick start

![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/IntroVirt/IntroVirt?color=brightgreen)

First, we need to get on the same kernel version supported by kvm-introvirt, which is currently Ubuntu Focal's `5.4.0-x`:

```bash
$ uname -r
5.4.0-109-generic
```

On Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal), we can revert to the Linux kernel version `5.4.0-x` by [disabling HWE](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack#Ubuntu_20.04_LTS_-_Focal_Fossa). The latest security patches are still provided by Canonical. To check if HWE is enabled, we can run `hwe-support-status` (no output means disabled, otherwise HWE is enabled).

To install on Ubuntu focal from the latest Github release.

```bash
mkdir introvirt_pkgs && cd introvirt_pkgs
wget https://github.com/IntroVirt/kvm-introvirt/releases/latest/download/kvm-introvirt.zip
wget https://github.com/IntroVirt/libmspdb/releases/latest/download/libmspdb.zip
wget https://github.com/IntroVirt/IntroVirt/releases/latest/download/introvirt.zip
unzip *.zip
sudo apt install *.deb
```

We will need to be booted into the correct kernel, based on the latest version of kvm-introvirt.
If properly configured, running `sudo ivversion` will return a supported hypervisor.

### Building on Ubuntu Linux

Install build dependencies:

If using the launchpad PPA, `libmspdb-dev` can be installed as a package:

```bash
sudo apt-get install cmake libcurl4-openssl-dev libboost-dev \
     libboost-program-options-dev libboost-stacktrace-dev \
     liblog4cxx-dev libmspdb-dev python3-jinja2 python3 \
     doxygen clang-format git
```

Otherwise, build and install libmspdb

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y cmake libcurl4-openssl-dev libboost-dev git
git clone https://github.com/IntroVirt/libmspdb.git
cd libmspdb/build/
cmake ..
make -j
sudo make install
```

Note: You will also have to build and install [kvm-introvirt](https://github.com/IntroVirt/kvm-introvirt/) if not using the PPA.

Build and install IntroVirt:

```bash
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
sudo make install
```

## Building a source package for Launchpad

First you'll need to copy the distro specific files into place:

```bash
cd debian/
cp control.focal control
cp changelog.focal changelog
dch -i # Bump the package version
cp changelog changelog.focal
cd ..
```

Next, build the source package:

```bash
debuild -S -sa
```

Finally, upload to launchpad

```bash
dput ppa:<ppa name> introvirt_<version>_source.changes
```

## Usage Instructions

The included IntroVirt tools have their own usage instructions. See the `tools/` folder.

You can try system call monitoring with `sudo ivsyscallmon -D <domain>`. See `sudo ivsyscallmon --help` for more information.
