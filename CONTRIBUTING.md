## Getting started developing for IntroVirt

IntroVirt development is best done on a supported version of Ubuntu. Right now that's Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04, 22.04, and 24.04 - we shoot to support the LTS releases. Once you're setup with a development system, clone the 3 repositories: [IntroVirt](https://github.com/IntroVirt/IntroVirt), [libmspdb](https://github.com/IntroVirt/libmspdb), and [kvm-introvirt](https://github.com/IntroVirt/kvm-introvirt) and follow the instructions in the main IntroVirt repository [README.md](https://github.com/IntroVirt/IntroVirt/blob/main/README.md) file to get building from source.
